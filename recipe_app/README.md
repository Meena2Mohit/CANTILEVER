### Interactive Details
The detail screen showcases the recipe with a large header image and clear instructions. It includes two key interactive features:
* **Dynamic Ingredient Scaling:** Users can increase or decrease the serving size, and all ingredient quantities are automatically recalculated in real-time.
* **Star Ratings:** Users can tap the rating to open a dialog and save their own rating for the recipe.
